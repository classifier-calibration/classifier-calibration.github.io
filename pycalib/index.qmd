We have developed a Python library that offers multiple tools to assess
probabilistic classifiers in terms of calibration, and provides useful function
to calibrate models that follow the Scikit-learn BaseEstimator standar.

The documentation for the library can be found at
[classifier-calibration.github.io/PyCalib/](https://classifier-calibration.github.io/PyCalib/) and the library can be
installed from the [PyPi package
repository](https://pypi.org/project/pycalib/).

# Citation

If you use the library for a research publication you may want to cite the
publication below, which provides a survey of classifier calibration and
mentions this Python library.
